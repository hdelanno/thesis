\chapter{The GEM and CSC Data Acquisition Systems}
\label{chap:II-2-daq}

  The installation of GEM detectors in CMS and the integration with the CSCs require the development of a new DAQ system for the GE1/1 project. The understanding of the structure of both the GEM and CSC readout chains as well as the common CMS central DAQ is of importance in the scope of this thesis. To this end, all three systems are presented in details in the sections that follow. \\
