\chapter{Irradiation Tests}
\label{chap:II-6-irradiation}

  The OptoHybrid will be located in a region of CMS exposed to high fluxes of particles, some of which might interact with the FPGA and generate errors in the logic. Those could in turn influence the functioning of the system and degrade its performance. To solve this issue, irradiation tests have been performed to measure the interaction cross-section of the particles with the various components of the FPGA. Two OptoHybrids have been placed in a high intensity proton beam with a dedicated firmware designed to detect errors. The two boards were each controlled by an additional OptoHybrid placed outside the test area which recorded the events and statistics. \\

  In this chapter, we provide the user with an overview of the internal architecture of an FPGA to better understand the potential sources of errors and the effects of radiation. We then describe the firmware of the irradiated and control FPGAs which has been used during the test. The setup and beam parameters of the irradiation test are reviewed before presenting the results that were obtained after analysis.

  \section{Architecture of an FPGA}

    To optimize the occupancy of the resources of the FPGA and develop code that uses the full potential of the device, a deep comprehension of the intrinsic architecture of the chip is required. Although families of FPGA differ in size and complexity, their building blocks remain the same and are described hereafter.

    \subsection{Configurable Logic Blocks}

      (CLBs) \cite{VIRTEX-CLB} are the base elements of the FPGA used to implement sequential and combinatorial logic. They are composed of two important objects: look-up tables (LUTs) and registers. LUTs are components which outputs are a function of the inputs as defined in a programmable table. They implement a truth table for every possible combination of the inputs which defines the value of the outputs. The response of a LUT to a change in the inputs is almost instantaneous. LUTs in the Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGAs can either implement functions with six inputs and a single output or functions with five inputs and two outputs. The outputs of the LUTs can, if so required by the design, be connect to registers which sample the signals at the rising edge of a given clock. Register are used for their sample-and-hold functionality which makes designs synchronous to clocks. With these two components, CLBs can implement complex functions and describe intricate systems. \\

        \label{fig:II-6-clb}
      \end{figure}

      Each CLB is composed of two slices each made of four LUTs and eight register which layout is shown in Figure \ref{fig:II-6-clb}. Each LUT is connected to an input bus of six signals (A, B, C, and D inputs) and to an unbuffered output bus of a single bit (O6 to A, B, C, and D). Four additional signals enter the slice (AX, BX, CX, and DX) and are connected to multiplexers (red) which allows to buffer either the former or the second output of the LUTs (O5). The output of the same buffer is then connected to a second multiplexer (orange) which allows to select either the former or an unbuffered output of the LUTs (AMUX, BMUX, CMUX, and DMUX). Finally, a third multiplexer (green) connects a range of signals to the registers on the right which are then connected to four outputs (AQ, BQ, CQ, and DQ). Three additional multiplexers (blue) offer the possibility to mix the signals from the four LUTs to generate a wider range of logical operations. The flexibility offered by this architecture is what enables FPGAs to implement complex designs. The Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA used in the OptoHybrid v2a (XC6VLX130T) holds 10 000 CLBs with a total of 80 000 LUTs and 160 000 registers.

    \subsection{The switching matrix}

      The inputs and outputs of the slices of the CLBs as well as of the other components of the FPGA are interconnected through the switching matrix. It is a vast network of wires and switches which are used to route signals between elements. The open or closed state of each switch is programmable and defines the routes signals follow inside the logic. Figure \ref{fig:II-6-switch} shows an element of the matrix connected to two slices (blue) along with the signals that are routed in the network (cyan). Complex designs can span a large area of the FPGA due to the high usage of logic and thus be difficult to place and route by the compiler. A technique called floorplanning is used to reduce compilation time and improve the design by constraining parts of the code to given areas in the FPGA.

        \label{fig:II-6-switch}
      \end{figure}

    \subsection{Block RAM}

      Besides programmable logic, the FPGA also includes dedicated storage elements. Block RAMs \cite{VIRTEX-RAM} (BRAMs) can store up to 36 kb of data which can be configured in different ways: 32K x 1 bit, 16K x 2 bits, etc. They can also be used as First In First Out (FIFO) modules which are similar to data queues.

    \subsection{Digital Signal Processing}

      Digital Signal Processing units (DSPs) \cite{VIRTEX-DSP} are modules which perform mathematical operations using dedicated hardware elements. They are used to quickly solve problems without relying on CLBs which can consume large amount of resources to perform an equivalent task. Figure \ref{fig:II-6-dsp} shows a diagram of the DSP48E1 slices present in the Xilinx Virtex-6 family. They include a 30-bits adder, a 25-bits by 18-bits multiplier, and a programmable module which can implement either a multiplication, an addition, or a logic operation. Using the various multiplexers and configuration bits, the user can define the data paths that are followed and thus create DSP modules which meets the requirements of the design.

    \subsection{The configuration memory}

      The configuration memory holds the configuration of the entire FPGA and defines its behavior. It sets the truth table of the LUTs, parametrizes the DSP, creates the connection between elements, etc. It is what implements the design in the FPGA. In most FPGAs, the configuration memory is volatile and will lose its configuration upon power down or reset. To reload it, the FPGA tries to read it out of an attached memory device or remains in a blank or corrupted state if it fails to do so.

  \section{The Effects of Radiation on FPGAs}

    When charged particles pass through an FPGA, they interact with the silicon substrate and deposit charge within the device. If the interaction takes place near a transistor, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:II-6-transistor}, the charges can affect the functioning of the component and induce a change of state. Alternatively, particles can produce current or voltage spikes which propagate in the design. Each type of interaction results in different effects in the FPGA. The most common are the Single Event Upsets (SEU) and Single Event Transients (SET). Besides being influenced by punctual events, the FPGA will also age and degrade due to the Total Integrated Dose (TID) of radiation.

    \begin{figure}[h!]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/II-6-irradiation/transistor.png}
      \caption{Charge deposition by a charged particle inside a transistor affecting the state of the circuit \cite{XILINX-RADIATION}.}
      \label{fig:II-6-transistor}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Single Event Upset}

      When the charge deposited by radiation is located within a transistor, the critical voltage of the latter can be modified and a change of state occur. In case of memory cells, a change of state corresponds to a bit flip, which can influence the design. If the configuration memory is hit, the description of the CLBs, DSPs, and switch matrix will change dynamically during run time and the implemented logic will thus be affected. For BRAMs, the bit flip will occur in the data stored in memory, resulting in corrupted information.

    \subsection{Single Event Transients}

      If the event affects combinatorial logic, a spike in current or voltage can be produced and propagate within the design. When coupled to sequential logic, such errors can be easily recovered from if their duration is small in comparison to the frequency of the clock used to run the circuit. Unless the error is produced exactly at the sampling time of the registers, it is not stored and thus mitigated.
