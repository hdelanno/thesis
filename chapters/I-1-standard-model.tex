\chapter{The Standard Model}
\label{chap:I-1-standard-model}

  The standard model (SM) of particle physics describes the elementary particles of nature and the interactions they undergo within a mathematical paradigm. It is well established thanks to the many precise prediction it does and to the experimental confirmation of these. The theory has been developped over years and aims at unifying all the forces of nature into a single one.
