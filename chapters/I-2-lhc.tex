\chapter{The Large Hadron Collider}
\label{chap:I-2-lhc}

	The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \cite{Evans:2008zzb} is a hadron accelerator and collider installed in a 26.7 km long tunnel beneath the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva, at a depth varying from 170 m below the Jura mountains to 45 m below the Leman lake. The tunnel was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) between 1984 and 1989 to host the former Large Electron Positron collider (LEP). As represented in Figure \ref{fig:I-2-lhc-schematic}, which provides a schematic illustration of the LHC, it is composed of eight arcs, eight straight sections (in between the arcs), and two transfer tunnels which connect the LHC to CERN's main injection complex. From the eight possible collision points located in the straight sections of the tunnel, only four are in use and instrumented with a total of seven particle detectors: ALICE \cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08002}, ATLAS \cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08003}, CMS \cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08004}, LHCb \cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08005}, TOTEM \cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08007}, LHCf \cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08006}, and MoEDAL \cite{Acharya:2014nyr}. \\

  The construction of the LHC, for which the concept dates back to 1984, was approved by the CERN Council in December 1994 and started in 1998 with the excavation of the caverns that would hold the experimentation sites. In 2003, the first section of the accelerator was assembled inside the tunnel marking the start of the installation phase of the LHC and its detectors, which would span until 2008. On September 10th 2008, the first beam of protons was circulated inside the LHC only to reveal a major technical issue with the superconducting magnets which halted the machine for nearly a year. In November 2009, reparation works were finished just in time for the LHC to produce its first collisions at 2.36 TeV before a Year-End Technical Stop (YETS), a yearly technical stop during which maintenance is performed on the machine. In February 2010, the LHC restarted with a physics program with collisions at 7 TeV that lasted until February 2013. At that time, the LHC stopped for two years during a Long Shutdown (LS) in order to perform upgrades to prepare it to run at 14 TeV. On June 3rd 2015, the LHC restarted and set a new record with an energy in the center of mass reference frame of 13 TeV.

  \section{The Injection Complex}

    The particles that enter the LHC are first created and accelerated by the injection complex of CERN which network of accelerators is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:I-2-injection-chain}. Protons are extracted from gaseous hydrogen by means of a duoplasmatron, a device that uses a heated filament cathode in conjunction with electric fields to produce electrons that will ionize and break the H$_2$ gas. The resulting protons have an energy of 100 keV and are injected in the Linac2 linear accelerator. \\

			\label{fig:I-2-injection-chain}
		\end{figure}

    Linac2 uses radio frequency cavities that produce an electromagnetic field inside the accelerator to transfer energy to the charged particles. The oscillations of the field allow the formation of bunches of particles by regrouping them on the front of the radio wave. The succession of cavities that form Linac2 boosts the incoming protons to an energy of 50 MeV before they enter the Booster. \\

    Following Linac2, three consecutive circular synchrotrons, namely the Proton Synchrotron Booster (Booster), the Proton Synchrotron (PS), and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), accelerate the beams to energies of respectively 1.4 GeV, 25 GeV, and 450 GeV. Each accelerator is composed of electromagnets that bend the trajectory of the beam and boost it further. From the SPS, the beam is injected in the LHC through two transfer tunnels into two rings where particles rotate in opposite directions to be further accelerated until they reach the desired energy. The SPS also provides beam to the North Area where various experiments take place and future technologies can be tested during test beam campaigns, frequently organized by CERN.

  \section{LHC Technical Description}

    Once inside the LHC, particles travel through two beam pipes which are subject to a vacuum of 10$^{-10}$ Torr, representing around 3 000 000 molecules per cm$^3$, which greatly reduces the collisions with the air and allows for greater beam longevity. The beam pipes do not form a perfect circle as they are composed of eight arcs and eight straight sections called insertions. \\

    Each arc contains 154 powerful dipole magnets, represented in Figure \ref{fig:I-2-magnet}, which produce a magnetic field higher than 8 T to bend the beams. The fields are generated by passing high currents through a coil of NbTi superconductor that surrounds the beam pipes cooled by liquid Helium bellow 2 K. The dipoles use a two-in-one design with a common cooling and housing system for the magnets of the two beam pipes which allows to reduce cost and space, and generate a magnetic flux circulating in opposite direction for the two rings. Due to the low temperature at which the magnets operate, the minimum energy deposition left by particles in the coils needed to trigger a quench, a sudden loss of superconductivity, is also decreased. A tight control of the beam structure must thus be enforced. Therefore, 49 quadrupole magnets are installed per section in order to focus the beams and reduce horizontal and vertical spread of the particles. \\

    The eight straight sections of the LHC have different use cases and designs: four of them are dedicated to the experiments and provide them with collisions, one contains the radio frequency cavities to accelerate the beams, two are used to clean the beam, and one to dump the beam. These functions are fulfilled by using various magnet designs to bend or deflect the beams. From the four collision sites, two also host the beam injection pipes from the SPS into the LHC. The beam cleaning insertions are used to remove particles with out-of-band momentum by scattering them on collimators. When the integrity of the beam is compromised, fast switching magnets activate at the dump insertion in order to quickly extract the particles from the LHC and redirect them to the dump site: an eight meter long graphite composite block that absorbs the energy of the beam.

	\section{Performance Goals}

  	The beams inside the LHC rings are composed of 2 808 bunches each made of approximately 110 billion protons. They are separated by 25 ns which is the time between two consecutive bunch crossing (BX), yielding a collision frequency of 40 MHz. During a collision, only a small fraction of the protons interact depending on various parameters such as the crossing angle of the beams, collimation of the bunches, etc. To quantify this, the notion of luminosity has to be introduced and is directly related to the frequency of apparition of events in a given interaction process
  	\begin{equation}
  		f_{process} = \mathcal{L} \sigma_{process} \ ,
  	\end{equation}
  	where $ f_{process} $ is the number of expected events per second, and $ \sigma_{process} $ is the interaction cross-section of the process. For a circular collider, the instantaneous luminosity is defined as
  	\begin{equation}
  		\mathcal{L} = f \frac{n_1 n_2}{4 \pi \sigma_x \sigma_y},
  	\end{equation}
  	where $ n_i $ is the number of protons or ions per bunch, $ f $ is the frequency of the collisions, and $ \sigma $ is the RMS of the transverse size of the beam in the $x$ and $y$ directions. These parameters change during the operation of the machine as the number of protons per bunch decreases and the bunches spread out. \\

    The instantaneous luminosity can be accumulated over a given period of time in order to obtain the integrated luminosity
  	\begin{equation}
  		L = \int \mathcal{L} \ dt ,
  	\end{equation}
  	which results in the number of events one can expect for a given interaction process
  	\begin{equation}
  		N_{process} = L \sigma_{process} .
  	\end{equation}
    Figure \ref{fig:I-2-luminosity} shows the peak and integrated luminosities delivered by the LHC to its four main experiments during 2016. It can be seen in the picture on the left that the highest instantaneous luminosity reached during that period is on the order of $ 14 \times 10^{33} $ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.

	\section{Operations and Schedule}

    Over the past years, the LHC has been building up in energy but also in luminosity in order to reach its nominal values of 14 TeV and $ 10^{34} $ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Figure \ref{fig:I-2-future} depicts the schedule of the LHC for the coming years throughout 2037 and the corresponding luminosities: peak on the left axis and integrated on the right axis. It can be seen that several LS are planned in order to upgrade the LHC and allow the experiments to perform maintenance and improvements. A noticeable increase in peak luminosity will occur after LS3 and mark the beginning of the so-called Phase II operation of the LHC. Such an increase in luminosity will affect the experiments due to the higher number of proton-proton collisions during each BX which will in turn translate to a higher flux of particles in the detectors. Preparing the LHC and the detectors to function at such a high luminosity is a challenge to which physicists and engineers are already providing answers.

  \section{Scientific Motivations for the LHC Upgrade}

    The high energy and luminosity at which the LHC operates are the key factors of its success. The new energy levels it unlocks enable scientists to explore hidden sectors of physics as new particles can be created through processes that were previously impossible to generate. Moreover, due to the rarity of these events that lie beyond the Standard Model, it is of importance to accumulate extensive statistics and thus run the machine at high luminosity. Not only physics beyond the Standard Model is being explored by the LHC. Measuring the free parameters of the theory and comparing them to theoretical and experimentally obtained values is also an important task which helps validate the models. Running at high luminosity allows the observation of rare processes such as the $ B^0_S $ meson decay, $ \bar{b}s \rightarrow \mu + \bar{\mu} $, which was first observed at the LHC \cite{b0smumu}. \\

    The discovery of the Higgs boson is one of the main goals of the LHC which has already been fulfilled. However, its characterization still requires a great amount of analysis in order to, for example, quantify the coupling constants to fermions or weak bosons, which today have a precision of about 20\%. These fine measurements make use of the study of rare events which will greatly benefit from the upgrade of the LHC towards higher luminosity, to reach a percent-level precision for most coupling measurements. Moreover, it is not excluded that other scalar bosons exist with lower production rates as predicted by some theories. In this case, the upgrade of the LHC becomes a necessity to detect the new exotic physics at play. \\

    The very high integrated luminosity that will be collected during the LHC Phase II will open the doors to searches for new heavy gauge bosons, extra dimensions, leptoquarks, dark matter candidates, etc. Their respective models predicted an extremely  low interaction cross section and thus require extensive data to be detected. Any discovery in this field would be ground breaking and open a new chapter in the history of particle physics. \\

    The measurements and observations described above are done by the detectors which are installed on the LHC using the collisions it provides. From the four large experiments the LHC hosts, two of them, namely ATLAS and CMS, are considered to be generalist as they are built to detect a wide range of interactions. ALICE and LHCb on the other hand are respectively optimized to study Pb-Pb interactions at lower energy which result in more particles in the final state, and b quark physics to understand the CP violation. The three smaller experiments, namely TOTEM, LHCf, and MoEDAL, use the forward particles detected far away from the interaction point to respectively analyze elastic collisions, simulate cosmic rays, and search for magnetic monopoles.
