\chapter{Developments for the Slice Test and the Final DAQ System}
\label{chap:II-4-slice-test}

  Using the feedback obtained during the test beam, a OptoHybrid v2b was developed which incorporated the QPLL and GBT chipsets. Firmware developments are required in order to make use of the latter and move from the GTX and SFP+ optical links to the GBT chipset coupled with the Versatil Link. \\

  Furthermore, as the VFAT3 ASIC entered production, simulations were ran in order to quantify parameters such as the data rates and the dead time of the analog front-end due to an undershoot effect.
